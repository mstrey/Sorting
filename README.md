#Sorting


This is an Android App to show diferent sorting algorithms working. I'm a Test Analist and as developer I'm at Junior level. If yout would help this project, fell free to join.

For now i just implement 3 diferent sorters but I wish to implement more in the future. The sorters implemented are:
- Bubble
- Selection
- Insertion
